This is HW5

assignment 1 (do Z test)

Generate N samples from a distribution but not Gaussian.

do Z test


Grading:

plot original distribution

plot at least one of the samples

plot the distribution of Z statistics

fit the Z-statistics with a guassian model

Run AD or KS

find the best fit values for the model parameters

Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit

Test whether a Gaussian model for  age distribution of citibike drivers is a sensible model, or if you can find a better fit

Use two of  KS, AD, KL, chisq. Test at least 2 distributions

Grading:

show the distributions, the models, clearly state the H_0
