Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

P0 = Average percentage of people on dieat in the test sample but they less lose or the same weight than who doesn't on diet 

P1 = Average percentage of people on exercise in longer who they significally lose weight 


Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

H0 = The average percentage of weight lost by people in the test sample on a diet is less or the same as for the control sample

H0 = Pt <= Pc

Ha = The average percentage of weight lost by the sample on exercise is larger or the same as by the sample o na diet alone

Ha = Pt > Pc


Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Sampe of 1,2,3, and 4 years of age children 



How much significant percentage of pregnant women who is smoking is delivered defected babies compare to preganat women who is not smoking  

H0: Mean IQ scoress for children whoese mothers smoke ( 10 or more cigarettes a day) during pregnancy are the same as mean for those whose mothers do not smoke.

H1: Mean IQ scores for children whose mother smoke 1- or more cigarettes a day during pregnancy are statistically indistrngushale from mean for those whose mothers do not somke.




Contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

H0: there is no spatial correlation between the prevalence of diabetes and the distribution of food desert
H1: there is a higher incidence of diabetes in proximity of food deserts/.


This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
